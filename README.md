## Rage Puzzle
I made this puzzle in an attempt to make one of the most challenging puzzles I could. The .ipt CAD file is attached. NOTE i'm not sure the splitting will appear properly in many CAD programs. It may just look like a block even though in inventor it is multiple bodies.


You can use this project by printing out the pieces and trying to solve the rage puzzle!
